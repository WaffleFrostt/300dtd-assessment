# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Secure Notes**

Project Author: **Tom Meldrum**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Notes are not secure enough. Anyone with access to your phone can see all your private notes. 

### End-User Requirements

My mum (Andrea) is the end user. She deals with blind clients and takes lots of notes on a work phone. But it tends to be quite sensitive information, and all work phones have the same password across all spheres of the organisation, even those in different fields to her. The simple notes app on these phones is the most convenient for client notes, but is super insecure. Even just a single custom password as a wall between the phone and the notes would be a huge win. Her clients deserve their confidential information to remain secure. 

### Proposed Solution

Three words: master password protection. It needs to be super secure, no password recovery, erases all data after 10 failed attempts. Shows the failed attempt count. Must be simple and aesthetic. 

First opened, prompted for Master Password or account creation. The account creation consists of a username and master password of choice. Notes are stored under corresponding users. Master Password starting page much like Bitwarden, no access to anything notes-wise until the password is input. Notes are organised into folders and can add and delete notes, notes must also be able to be modified. It's also just as important for the notes app to remain as simple ass possible. Its made for quick notes, so it must be efficient to use and have as little on the UI as possible, whilst remaining at full functionality. 


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability is a simple yet crucial part of a site/app. This defines how simple it is for the user to traverse the site. 

This app is made for quick notes, so it is crucial it is simple and quick to just get the words down. 

Keep features easy to access. Everything should be accessible from the home page. 

### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

How the website can be used in numerous ways to create the most efficient experience. 

The notes must be able to be accessed from anywhere, and must be able to create a new note from anywhere. I must be able to balance security and ease of use. 

Everything must link back to the home page, and never be in too deep to any one function. Backing out must be as easy as going in. The interface must also be as open plan as possible. 

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

A good looking and uncomplicated UI. 

It is crucial this app contains the least amount of headaches as possible. If this app is to be effective, it needs to be so usable that the end user wants to use it.   

The design will be simple and clean. It will have as little unnecessary features as possible, while maintaining a functioning and minimalist design. This will ensure the site is wanted to be used over the competition (regular notes app). Alongside my security feature, as long as my site is minimalist enough to fit its simple purpose, it will be desirable to the end user.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### User-centricity

User-centricity means building the site around the user. Think like a user when designing etc.

The entire point of this notes app is something that closely resembles the regular notes app, just with an added feature of security. Building around the user will give them the closest match to what they've been previously used to.

## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
