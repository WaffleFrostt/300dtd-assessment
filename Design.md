# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Secure Notes**

Project Author: **Tom Meldrum**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Notes are not secure enough. Anyone with access to your phone can see all your private notes. 

### End-User Requirements



### Proposed Solution

Three words: master password protection. It needs to be super secure, no password recovery, erases all data after 10 failed attempts. Shows the failed attempt count. Must be simple and aesthetic. 

First opened, prompted for Master Password or account creation. The account creation consists of a username and master password of choice. Notes are stored under corresponding users. Master Password starting page much like Bitwarden, no access to anything notes-wise until the password is input. Notes are organised into folders and can add and delete notes, notes must also be able to be modified.
