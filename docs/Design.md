# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Secure Notes**

Project Author: **Tom Meldrum**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Notes are not secure enough. Anyone with access to your phone can see all your private notes. 

### End-User Requirements

My mum (Andrea) is the end user. She deals with blind clients and takes lots of notes on a work phone. But it tends to be quite sensitive information, and all work phones have the same password across all spheres of the organisation, even those in different fields to her. The simple notes app on these phones is the most convenient for client notes, but is super insecure. Even just a single custom password as a wall between the phone and the notes would be a huge win. Her clients deserve their confidential information to remain secure. But while she will be the end user feedback wise, the system must also function as a secure notes app used by anyone. To achieve that, I will base my design similarly to other notes apps, while including the features stated by the end user. This will not only solve the end user identified need/problem, but also create a useful and secure notes app for any users to utilise. 

### Proposed Solution

Three words: master password protection. It needs to be super secure, no password recovery, erases all data after 10 failed attempts. Shows the failed attempt count. Must be simple and aesthetic. 

First opened, prompted for Master Password or account creation. The account creation consists of a username and master password of choice. Notes are stored under corresponding users. Master Password starting page much like Bitwarden, no access to anything notes-wise until the password is input. Notes are organised into folders and can add and delete notes, notes must also be able to be modified. It's also just as important for the notes app to remain as simple ass possible. Its made for quick notes, so it must be efficient to use and have as little on the UI as possible, whilst remaining at full functionality. 

- Account Creation: There won't be account creation in the traditional sense, instead, there will be a password input screen where you initially choose a password, then whenever returning, must have it input to access the notes. 

- Notes Viewing: There will deliberately not be folders as it isn't very relevant to the end user. Unless they say they want them I won't bother adding them. Its not super difficult or anything, so I don't feel like it makes my site anymore impressive, just one more roadblock and page to geth through that I just don't see being useful. 

- Screen orientation: I am designing this app for a phone screen. This means I wont have lots of stuff like menus on the screen, and have everything accessed through one click. Login to note display to note open to note add all on different pages but all within a single click.

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability is a simple yet crucial part of a site/app. This defines how simple it is for the user to traverse the site. 

This app is made for quick notes, so it is crucial it is simple and quick to just get the words down. The entire point of this notes app is something that closely resembles the regular notes app, just with an added feature of security. Building around the user will give them the closest match to what they've been previously used to.

Keep features easy to access. Everything should be accessible from the home page. They should come as naturally as possible. They must work, and they must work how you would expect. 


### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

How the website can be used in numerous ways to create the most efficient experience. 

The notes must be able to be accessed from anywhere, and must be able to create a new note from anywhere. I must be able to balance security and ease of use. 

Everything must link back to the home page, and never be in too deep to any one function. Backing out must be as easy as going in. The interface must also be as open plan as possible. 

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

A good looking and uncomplicated UI. 

It is crucial this app contains the least amount of headaches as possible. If this app is to be effective, it needs to be so usable that the end user wants to use it.   

The design will be simple and clean. It will have as little unnecessary features as possible, while maintaining a functioning and minimalist design. This will ensure the site is wanted to be used over the competition (regular notes app). Alongside my security feature, as long as my site is minimalist enough to fit its simple purpose, it will be desirable to the end user.

### Privacy

How user data and security is protected.

Half the point of my app is security, so privacy is a largely important heuristic that I must follow. User data stored inside my app will have to have a guarantee of protection, otherwise my promise of a 'secure notes' app will be wrong, rendering my app pointless. 

I will make sure there are no loopholes with the login section, and no easy way to breach the login either. I will try to break it in as many ways as I can to ensure that the promise of security is genuine. Then I can accurately class my app as 'secure'. 


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### User-centricity

User-centricity means building the site around the user. Think like a user when designing etc.

The entire point of this notes app is something that closely resembles the regular notes app, just with an added feature of security. Building around the user will give them the closest match to what they've been previously used to.

I will take inspiration from the native notes app, and build around using the heuristics it follows to ensure a user central interface. 



### Consistency

Keeping the design consistent across all pages and actions. Both in look and function. 

Because simplicity is key for my project consistency is important. As notes apps are very formularised already, this app will need to meet that expectation and remain consistent throughout. 

I will keep consistent to the general look and function of a notes app, so it is expected by the user. But I will also keep the look consistent with colours and layout. That way, the user subconsciously knows how to traverse the site without needing to put much thought into it.  


### Findable

Systems are easy to navigate so the users are able to access and find the content they need.

My notes app is based on the business model of fast and easy phone access. That means that each section should be where you would commonly expect it to be. 

This should be contingent on other notes apps so the layout is previously familiar to a degree. I will also have clearly laid out pages with large headings at the top to show exactly where the user is on the app.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Primary end user Andrea needed a secure yet efficient way to store and manage info on clients for her work phone. I provided this with a hash encrypted accounts with no way to see any stored notes without it. The session was also used to ensure no backdoor access was possible. The apps design is simple and quick to use, following from a typical notes app layout for ease of use for any user. Editing notes could not be easier, all done within the view, no need to go through multiple pages, its all right there. All while being secure makes this notes app a valuable product to meet the end user requirements.

### Meeting the System Requirements

The system requirements were directed at creating a secure minimalist notes app. Features include account creation, folder creation, complete freedom of notes editing and deletion, and a simple yet clean interface. Features such as the light to dark mode toggle were removed due to difficulty to implement to an acceptable level, and it wasnâ€™t a particularly useful or necessary feature, while being one that took up space on the screen taking away from the minimalism across the pages. The password strength test indicator was also removed despite me getting it working. I felt it was not important, and wanted to give users the change to have a short simple pin like password, for ease of access. Despite the changes, this design meets the system requirements. 

### Review of **Privacy**

Privacy was a key focus throughout creating this project right from the get go. The system was designed to take into account all user data is protected. Anyone could access the phones of the users, but with the security of the account system, it is too difficult to be worth accessing considering the end user requirements. This ensures that the data is almost certainly secure. Special care was taken to ensure there was no backdoor accessing to anything. I stores the login in the session, and made each link only accessible if it matched up with the session. After closed, the user must sign back in. 

### Review of **Usability**

Usability was also a main consideration in the creation of the project. The app was designed specifically to make sense, and be straightforward, because it didnâ€™t need to be more than that. I wanted everything to be available within one click from the home page, and that was achieved. The user interface was clear, giving users the option to quickly create, view, and edit notes. Including just one page with the notes within the folders and not one pager for folders and one fore notes was a success in ensuring simplicity and efficiency. Screenshots of the final design show this, every page s shown in the screenshot, yet all the features the users need are present. 

### Review of **Consistency**

Consistency was maintained across the apps design and functions. The back buttons are in the same place, and any submits remain central and blow the content. Pages are much the same in look, and features work in accord to each other. Consistency is important, as the end user stated they do not wish to spend time figuring it out, it should come naturally and be super quick to use if it wishes to achieve its goal. All shown in screenshots. 

### Review of **User-centricity**

The design was heavily user centred. The design was modelled after existsing notes apps to keep the familiarity, but then added security on top. Choices to prioritise dark mode, and simplify the UI were on direct end user feedback.
